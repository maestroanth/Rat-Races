# Rat-Races

About: Rat Races was my first serious school project way back for my associates degree at Front Range.  At it's heart is just a fun experimental pac-man style video game that although I'm not currently doing anything more with it, I encourage anybody who downloads this repository to try recoding things and come up with something new and awesome! 

However, my apologies for the "bloatiness" of this repository because with it has some irrelevant things such as practice files and duplicate files so I wouldn't have to go in and edit all the path locations again when I made the .exe file.

Languages: This was created in Visual Studio using C++ and the SDL library.

Purpose: This project was my first attempt to be a "master of all trades". By this I mean: I drew the mouse and animation frames, made the sound effects, wrote the music using Finale, played some of the soundbytes on the piano (such as the fox logo theme for the victory screen soundbyte, and a crashing annoying soundbyte for the losing screen), and coding it FROM SCRATCH (no copy and pasting!) to put it all together.  Took A LOT of time.

Features: Although there is only 1 executeable file, there is code for two versions of the game.
